##Intro-
    
Program, can be defined in many ways. Often, it is given at the start of an event detailing what you can expect to see/do while attending. In the case of a computer: it is a set of instructions, written in a language a compiler can interpret, to be executed by the computer. A compiler is also a program, or set of programs, which will convert the code you've written and transform it into machine language, in most cases a bunch of 0s and 1s (aka binary). In high school my computer science teacher said, "Computers are dumb and they're only good at following commands. So, don't beat around the bush. Give it to him straight.” A program is a tool for you to tell the computer what to do. It gives you the ability to interact with the hardware or software. This simple ability is the reason you can connect to the internet, and read what's on this website in this moment. It gives you the ability to create worlds at the stroke of your fingertips.

##Explanation-
	
The quintessential computer program taught by all is the "Hello World" program. A simple execution of a print/output statement in the relevant programming language.

##Example(s)-
    
I will primarily be using javascript for examples, but here is the "Hello World" program in various languages, try them out at [https://repl.it](https://repl.it/languages) (it'd be helpful to open this a new tab!):

###*Python*:
{% highlight python %}
print ("¡Hola, mundo!")
{% endhighlight %}
###*C++*:
{% highlight C++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!";
}
{% endhighlight %}
###*Javascript*:
{% highlight javascript %}
console.log('Hello, world!');
{% endhighlight %}

##Popular Uses:
A program is used in: encoding mp3s, finding directions from Pamplona to Madrid, listening to music on Spotify, and allowing you to read this post on my website. This specific example is the quintessential introduction to any programming language or intro programming course.
